<h1>Safekey DB</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
A SE 370 Project that stores encrypted passwords into a database.<br>
Project developed by Andrew Le, Ruth Jimenez, Carter Rath, Jerstine Medrano
<br>
In SE 370, we are required to create a competiting program with the same goals against another group of students. With this specific goal in mind, our team explored a variety of different ways to store passwords. Through this exploration, we found that mySQL was the best DB to use for this specific program. 
<br>

<h2>Tools and Utilities Used</h2>
- <b>Java:</b> Language used to create the user interface for the Safekey DB application. Java also provides a built-in MessageDigest class for SHA-256 hashing of the passwords. 
<br />
- <b>mySQL:</b> Database used to store the encrypted passwords.
